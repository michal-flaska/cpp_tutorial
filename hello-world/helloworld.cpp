/*
Notes:
- First C++ program - classic hello world
- #include <iostream> needed for input/output
- std::cout for output, << to send text to it
- '\n' for new line (could also use std::endl)
- return 0 means program executed successfully
- Comments with // for single line, /* * / for multiple lines
*/
