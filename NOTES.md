## Taking personal notes from what I've learned

- `return 0` means that the program will execute successfully and did what it was intended to do.
- `return 1` means that there is some error while executing the program, and it is not performing what it was intended to do.
- `cout` means 'character out'
- `std` is not a sexually transmitted disease
- `std::cout` means 'standard character output'
- at the end of statements, we add `;` (semicolon). Means that the statement is done. -> just like in javascript.
- to write a comment, you use two slashes `//`
- multiline comment -> written like in css -> `/* content (can be multiple lines) */`
- `int` (integer) can only store full numbers (1, 8, 16, 21, 17, etc.)
- `double` can also store decimals

- Break Line:
  - `std::endl` means end line (breakline -> `<br />`)
  - can be also written as `'\n'` -> much more used
  - Benefit of using `endl` is that the end line will flush the output buffer

- `std::cout << "This is a text" << '\n';` can also be written like this: `std::cout << "This is a text\n";`

- All of other notes are contained at the bottom of all .cpp files as `Recap:` or `Notes:`.
